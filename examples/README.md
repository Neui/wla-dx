examples
========

This folder contains some very simple programs written using WLA DX to
demonstrate some features.
If that isn't enough, take a look at the tests in the `tests` folder one
directory above.

Each folder is a seperate CMake project. The toplevel CMakeLists.txt just
includes all subprojects. The Makefile just do the same.

If you'd like to contribute, please pick a system that haven't been covered,
because this repository shouldn't be flooded by examples. Also keep them
simple, no complete games.

Side note: The old examples were more like test and were moved to the `tests`
folder, along with some edits.
