wla-dx for Debian
----------------

This version still uses a "custom" build system, using shell scripts to drive
the makefiles, which actually builds a part of it.

If you're building from git, you might encounter "modified files" message
for 3 files. git wants to modify them, but it can't be done since then it
wouldn't be the "original" source.
